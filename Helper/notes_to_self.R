# ### NOTES TO SELF
#
# Also have to fix the Viney Bates and King example
#
# Decide which maximum to keep
#     - Need a date function
#       if there is too little data, is the data the maximum common with nearby observations
#     - Run King (Take a while)
#     - Run Viney Bates (Take a while)
#
# Combine all observations into a data frame to use (one file)
